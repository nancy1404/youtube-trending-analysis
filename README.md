## 🎯 Project Highlights

- Analyzed **2.9M+ YouTube Trending records** across **11 countries** using the Kaggle *YouTube Trending Video* dataset.  
- Framed virality as a **binary classification task** (top decile by views) and built models to predict whether a video will be **viral vs. non-viral**.  
- Engineered **time-to-trending** and **engagement-velocity** features (likes/hour, comments/hour, engagement/hour) to capture *how fast* videos gain traction.  
- Trained and compared multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Naive Bayes) with **strong ROC-AUC and recall** on the viral class.  
- Built **per-country notebooks** plus a **Global notebook** to study **regional differences** in virality and trending speed.  
- Performed targeted **error analysis** (false positives/negatives) to uncover slow-burn virality and country-specific behaviors that raw metrics miss.

---

### 4. Download the dataset(s)

1. Go to the Kaggle dataset: **“YouTube Trending Video Dataset”**.
2. Download all country files (e.g., `US_youtube_trending_data.csv`, `KR_youtube_trending_data.csv`, etc.).
3. Place them in the `datasets/` folder (this folder is **not** tracked in git due to file size):

```plaintext
youtube-trending-analysis/
├── datasets/
│   ├── US_youtube_trending_data.csv
│   ├── CA_youtube_trending_data.csv
│   ├── ...
│   └── KR_youtube_trending_data.csv
```

If you also use YouTube API–based files (e.g., category ID → category name mappings), place them in the same `datasets/` folder.

---

### 5. Launch Jupyter and open the notebooks

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open:

- `notebooks/Global_Notebook.ipynb` for the global pipeline.  
- `notebooks/XX_Notebook.ipynb` for each country (`US`, `CA`, `GB`, `DE`, `FR`, `BR`, `MX`, `IN`, `RU`, `JP`, `KR`).

## 🏗️ Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the **Break Through Tech AI Studio** program, in partnership with **Google**.  
The challenge focused on understanding **YouTube virality** and **Trending behavior** across countries.

### Problem Framing

**Core questions:**

1. **Virality**  
   Can we predict which videos will become **“viral”** (top 10% by views) using only early **engagement** and **metadata**?

2. **Trending Speed**  
   Given a video that reaches Trending, can we estimate **how long it takes** to get there (e.g., days from publish to first Trending appearance)?

### Real-World Significance

YouTube hosts **millions of uploads per day** — it’s impossible for humans to manually screen or prioritize them.

Understanding signals of **virality** and **trending speed** can help:

- Content teams design better **posting strategies**.  
- Platforms monitor **algorithmic amplification** and potential bias.  
- Creators interpret whether **early signals** are promising or not.

## 📊 Data Exploration

### Dataset Summary

- **Source:** Kaggle — *YouTube Trending Video Dataset*  
- **Countries:** 11 (e.g., `US`, `CA`, `GB`, `DE`, `FR`, `BR`, `MX`, `IN`, `RU`, `JP`, `KR`)  
- **Rows:** ~2.9 million total  

**Raw fields:**

- **Engagement:** `view_count`, `likes`, `dislikes` (legacy), `comment_count`  
- **Metadata:** `title`, `tags`, `channel_title`, `category_id`, `description`  
- **Time:** `publish_time`, `trending_date`  
- **Other:** `thumbnail_link`, `comments_disabled`, `ratings_disabled`  

### Key Preprocessing Steps

Across notebooks, we typically:

- Parsed and aligned **date/time** columns (`publish_time`, `trending_date`).  
- Removed or imputed rows with missing core fields (**views**, **likes**, **comments**).  
- Dropped fields not usable for modeling (e.g., raw thumbnail links).  
- Filtered out **extreme outliers** where needed when training regression models.  

### Feature Engineering

Some of the main engineered features included:

**Time-based:**

- `publish_hour`  
- `publish_dayofweek`  
- `days_to_trending` and/or `hours_to_trending`  
  - (difference between `publish_time` and first `trending_date`)  

**Metadata richness:**

- `title_length` (characters)  
- `tag_count` (number of tags)  

**Engagement-velocity** (core to virality):

- `likes_per_hour`  
- `comments_per_hour`  
- `engagement_per_hour` (e.g., `(likes + comments) / hours_since_publish`)  

**Virality label:**

- For each country, defined a **“viral”** flag as being in the **top 10%** of `view_count` (or views per day) at the time of observation.

### EDA Highlights

- Viral videos typically have **much higher engagement velocity early on**, not just more total views.  
- Some markets (e.g., **KR, IN, RU**) show **faster days-to-trending** compared with others (e.g., **US, CA, JP**).  
- Category effects exist but are often weaker than **engagement** and **timing** features.

## 🧠 Model Development

We framed the work as two related tasks:

- **Classification:** Predict whether a video is **viral** (top decile) vs. **non-viral**.  
- **Regression:** Estimate **time-to-trending** for videos that hit Trending.  

### Models Used

**Classification:**

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- XGBoost Classifier  
- Naive Bayes (as a simpler baseline)  

**Regression:**

- Linear Regression on **log-transformed** targets  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- XGBoost Regressor  

### Typical Training Setup

- Train/validation split (e.g., **70/30**) within each country or region.  
- Scaling numeric features (e.g., `StandardScaler`) and one-hot encoding categorical fields using `ColumnTransformer`.  
- **Main classification metric:** `ROC-AUC`, with **recall on the viral class** as a secondary focus.  
- **Main regression metrics:** `MAE`, `RMSE`, and `R²`.  

### Handling Imbalance

Because only ~10% of samples are labeled **viral**, we experimented with:

- Class weights (e.g., `class_weight="balanced"`).  
- **Threshold tuning** (moving away from 0.5) to recover better viral recall.

## 📈 Results & Key Findings

> Note: Exact metrics may vary by country notebook; this section summarizes the overall behavior observed across runs.

### Classification Performance

- Tree-based models (**Random Forest**, **XGBoost**) consistently outperformed baselines.  
- **ROC-AUC** for the best models was typically **high** (≈ 0.96+ in many regions), with strong separation between **viral** and **non-viral** classes.  
- **Engagement-velocity** features (`likes_per_hour`, `comments_per_hour`, `engagement_per_hour`) were almost always among the **top feature importances**.  

### Regression (Time-to-Trending)

- Best regression models achieved **MAE ~1.5–2 days** and **moderate R²** (the platform has inherent randomness and unobserved factors).  
- Some markets trend faster on average; others have more **latency** between publish and Trending, even for videos that eventually go viral.  

### Behavioral Insights

**Velocity > raw counts**  
A video with modest total views but **high early engagement rate** is more likely to be predicted viral than a slow-growing video with bigger absolute numbers.

**Country differences:**

- Certain countries show more **“flash” virality** (quick spikes, fast Trending).  
- Others exhibit **slow-burn** trajectories where videos accumulate views over time before finally hitting Trending.  

**Error analysis:**

- **False positives:** High early engagement that never quite crosses the Trending threshold (e.g., niche but very loyal audiences).  
- **False negatives:** Videos that start slow but later surge due to external events, news cycles, or creator promotion — behavior that isn’t fully captured by simple early-time features.

## 🚀 Next Steps

If we had more time or production constraints, we would explore:

### Richer text understanding

- Use multilingual models (e.g., **BERT variants**) to embed **titles, descriptions, and tags**.

### Temporal modeling

- Replace single “snapshot” features with **time-series curves** (engagement over 12–48 hours) and model them via **RNN**, **TCN**, or **temporal transformers**.

### Fairness & bias analysis

- Examine model performance across **categories**, **countries**, and **channel sizes** to see where predictions might systematically favor or penalize certain creators.

### Peak performance prediction

- Instead of only viral vs. non-viral, predict **future peak views** or **watch time** as a continuous outcome.

### Deployment-oriented work

- Wrap the best model in a simple **API** and create a lightweight **dashboard** for “what-if” analyses (e.g., *“What if we shift publish hour?”*).
